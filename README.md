This thesis explores the potential for introducing and popularizing baseball in India, a nation 
influenced by cricket and other traditional sports. Despite the global popularity of baseball, its 
market feasibility and consumer acceptance in India remain unexamined. This study aims to 
fill this gap by evaluating the market dynamics, consumer preferences, and strategic
frameworks necessary for baseball's successful introduction into the Indian sports landscape.
Employing a mixed-methods approach, the research synthesizes data from extensive 
literature reviews, market analysis reports, consumer surveys, and interviews with sports 
management professionals. The literature review highlights the global status of baseball, 
focusing on its historical growth trajectories in regions like India and examining the factors 
contributing to its success or failure. It also provides a comparative analysis with cricket, 
identifying potential synergies and barriers to baseball's acceptance among Indian audiences.
The research identifies several critical factors influencing the potential success of 
baseball in India, including cultural compatibility, infrastructure availability, and the role of 
media and marketing in shaping public perception. Furthermore, it delves into the strategic 
implications of global sports management practices, drawing parallels with the Indian context 
to propose a tailored approach for market entry. Findings suggest a significant interest in 
diverse sports among India's younger demographics, driven by increased international 
exposure and a growing appetite for new sports experiences. However, challenges such as 
limited infrastructure, the need for grassroots development programs, and competition with 
established sports like cricket pose considerable barriers to baseball's widespread adoption.
Strategically, the thesis proposes a multi-faceted approach to introducing baseball in 
India, emphasizing the importance of localized marketing strategies, partnerships with 
educational institutions for talent development, and leveraging digital platforms for 
engagement and fan base growth. Policy recommendations focus on government and private 
sector collaboration to develop necessary sports infrastructure and promote baseball as an 
inclusive, accessible sport.
Conclusively, the thesis presents a comprehensive framework for assessing the 
potential for baseball in India, offering insights into market dynamics, consumer behavior, and 
strategic entry points. It contributes to the broader discourse on sports globalization, providing 
a roadmap for introducing international sports into new markets
